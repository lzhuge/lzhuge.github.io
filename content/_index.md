description: "I am a Research Fellow at the `New Zealand Policy Research Institute` (NZPRI, AUT). I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from `Boston University`, specializing in labor and development economics and corporate finance. My research explores how social norms, cultural dynamics, and policy environments influence intrahousehold bargaining and labor supply decisions, as well as corporate innovation and environmental performance. I have extensive experience working with micro-level data on households, individuals, and firms. I excel in advanced econometric techniques and programming across multiple languages and computing platforms."
