description: "I am a Research Fellow at the `New Zealand Policy Research Institute` (NZPRI, AUT). I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from `Boston University`. My research spans labor economics, development economics, environmental economics, and corporate finance. I investigate how social norms and public policies influence individual behavior, corporate environmental performance and innovation, as well as how environmental change affects individual welfare. I have extensive experience working with micro-level data on households, individuals, and firms. I specialize in advanced econometric methods and am proficient in programming across multiple languages and computing platforms."
